## About

We decided to build an app that would allow users to be able to calculate the carbon footprint of car journeys. The user can input their licence plate and the distance travelled and the app returns the amount of CO2 consumed, as well as activities that would consume a similar amount of CO2. There is also a link to an organisation that allows the user to pay to offset their carbon emissions.

We used React Native to create an E2E mobile app experience for the user. Our app is a one stop shop for the environmentally conscious who want to limit the impact of their daily activities on global warming by taking steps to offset their CO2 emissions.

Check out our demo video (DEMO) to see how the application works in practice!
