- Taking five minute showers for a whole year would save as much CO2 as is sequestered annually by half an acre of U.S. forest.

| Shower time | 1 Minute | 2 Minutes | 3 Minutes | 4 Minutes | 5 Minutes |
| ----------- | -------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| CO2 grams   | 204.1    | 408.2     | 612.4     | 816.5     | 1020.6    |

- Taking only five minute showers for the next 30 days would save 108 lbs of CO2, which is more than what a tree seedlings grown for 10 years can sequester (1.27 times more to be precise)!

- Domestic laundry has a surprisingly large carbon footprint. The power needed to run household appliances, and especially the energy required to heat up water, has a carbon footprint that’s largely invisible to householders. Yet all of our water use adds up. It accounts for 6% of all carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the UK.

- The bulk of the emissions from household water use, comes from the energy needed to heat water in the home, about 46% if a gas boiler is used. About 17% of the emissions come from using dishwashers, and 11% from washing machines.

- The carbon footprint of a load of laundry:

  - 0.6 kg CO2e washed at 30°C, dried on the line
  - 0.7 kg CO2e washed at 40°C, dried on the line
  - 2.4 kg CO2e washed at 40°C, tumble-dried in a vented dryer
  - 3.3 kg CO2e washed at 60°C, dried in a combined washer-dryer

- The kitchen sink is actually the source of the most water-related carbon emissions in the home. Keeping the kitchen tap running leads to approximately 157kg of CO2 being released per year while the dishwasher produces 142kg of CO2, the washing machine generates 118kg and the bath creates 103kg. (In a newer home, however, the shower is the water-use device with the highest emissions.)
